* A **User** can make **multiple Bookings** as a guest. (One-to-Many: `Users.id` to `Bookings.guest_id`)
* A **Property** can have **multiple Bookings**. (One-to-Many: `Properties.id` to `Bookings.property_id`)
* A **Booking** is made by one **User** (guest) for one **Property**. (Many-to-One: `Bookings.guest_id` to `Users.id` and `Bookings.property_id` to `Properties.id`)
* A **Booking** can have **one Review** (after completion). (One-to-One: `Bookings.id` to `Reviews.booking_id`)
* A **User** can write **multiple Reviews**. (One-to-Many: `Users.id` to `Reviews.reviewer_id`)
* A **Property** can receive **multiple Reviews**. (One-to-Many: `Properties.id` to `Reviews.property_id`)
* A **Booking** can be associated with **one or more Payments** (e.g., partial payments, refunds, though usually one primary payment). For simplicity, we'll model it as **one Payment per Booking** for now, but acknowledge it could be One-to-Many if partial payments are implemented. (One-to-One / One-to-Many: `Bookings.id` to `Payments.booking_id`)
* A **User** can initiate **multiple Payments**. (One-to-Many: `Users.id` to `Payments.user_id`)
